% The following script presents an introduction to basic MATLAB
% commands. It shows how different types of variables can be
% handled and manipulated in MATLAB, as well as how MATLAB can 
% be used to produce graphical output. 

%% Numeric variables
% In MATLAB, an assignment of a certain value to a variable has 
% to be implemented with an equality sign, where any 
% expression on the right-hand side of the equality is assigned 
% to the variable which is specified on the left-hand side.
% Variable names in MATLAB have to start with a letter, which 
% can be followed by any number of letters, digits or
% underscores. Note that MATLAB is case sensitive, i.e. that
% lowercase and uppercase letters are distinguished.

% assign value 2 to a variable named x
x = 2


%%
% You can also see the effect of the assignment in the workspace
% window. The column "value" now shows a 2 next to the entry x.
% The same syntax also can be used when the value of a given
% variable shall be assigned to another variable.

% assign value of variable x to variable b
b = x

%%
% In order not to trigger an error, every variable on the 
% right-hand side of an equality sign already has to possess a 
% value.

% assignment with still undefined variable 
try
    d = c
catch err
    err.message
end
    
%%
% While the first expression assigns the value of the variable x
% to the variable b, execution of the second expression will lead
% to an error, since the variable on the left-hand side is not
% yet defined. Leaving the error untreated would force MATLAB to 
% stop the execution of the script, and throw an error message in
% red letters. 
% In order to avoid an abortion, the error is treated with a 
% try-catch construction at this point. To see the result of an 
% untreated error, just uncomment the following line and execute 
% the cell again.

% d = c

%%
% In order to assign a bundle of values to one variable, the
% values can be stored lined up horizontally or vertically, so
% that the containing variable becomes a vector. When values
% shall be lined up horizontally, MATLAB needs to know the index
% indicating the position of the value in the vector. Thereby the
% first position in a vector always gets index 1, contrary to
% 0 as in some other programming languages.

x(2) = 4

%%
% Assigning value 4 to the second position renders x into a
% 1x2 horizontal vector. 
% To meet larger generality, it is best to interpret scalar 
% values and vectors as special cases of the larger class of 
% matrices right away. Hence, any assignment needs two indices 
% to uniquely specify a position in a matrix.

x(1,2) = 4

%%
% Following the usual mathematical notation, the first index 
% refers to the vertical position, and the second index to the 
% horizontal position. 

x(2,1) = 3
x(2,2) = 4

%%
% Explained more precisely, the original assignment x = 2 actually
% performs two commands. First, the value 2 is assigned to the
% variable x. And second, the new value of the variable x is displayed
% in the command window.
%
% In order to prevent MATLAB from displaying the new state of a
% variable, each assignment has to be equipped with a semicolon
% at its end. Hence, displaying the new value of a variable after
% an assignment can be seen as something like a default setting,
% which has to be denied explicitly when it is not wanted.

% the following assignment is not displayed
x(2,2) = 8;

% to query the new value, type the variable name
x

%%
% Given that we assign a value outside of the already used 
% rectangular of indices, the matrix is automatically increased
% to include the new index, while elements of the enlarged matrix
% without specified values are automatically filled with zeros.

x(3,4) = 8

%%
% Note that MATLAB is forced to automatically enlargen the
% matrix, since it can only work with numerical variables of
% rectangular shape. An example with occurring error in case of
% misspecified matrix shape will follow at the end of the next 
% cell.

%%
% In order to simplify the assignment of a bunch of numbers, all
% matrix entries also can be assigned all at once. Be careful:
% the syntax in this case requires SQUARED brackets!
% Furthermore, the semicolons within the squared brackets tell 
% MATLAB to assign the next values to positions one row further
% down. 

% assigning multiple values at once
x = [1 2 0; 1 3 4; 2 2 2]


%%
% Note: for clarity one can also use commas in order to better
% delimit individual entries within a row.

x = [2, 3, 4; 1, 3, 1; 2, 2, 2]

%%
% As already mentioned, unequal dimensions produce an error.

try
    k = [2 2 2 2 2; 1 1; 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4]
catch err
    err.message
end

%%
% Once a variable has been initialized through value assignments,
% there are several ways to find out all its values or the value 
% at any entry.
% The first way is to display the variable to the command window 
% by simply typing its name. However, when dealing with large 
% matrices, it is not convenient to let MATLAB display the 
% complete matrix. A preferable way is to let MATLAB display 
% only the entry required, which can be done by telling MATLAB 
% the variable name associated with an index in square brackets.

% get value at row 1, column 2
x(1,2)

%%
% A different way to find out any value of a variable is to use 
% the variable editor, which can be opened either by 
% double-clicking the variable's name in the workspace, or by 
% highlighting the variable's name, right-clicking and chosing 
% "Open".

%% Matrix Concatenation
% Since MATLAB originally was built on matrix calculations,
% MATLAB programs involve a lot of matrix manipulations.
% Therefore, MATLAB provides an auxiliary merging-operator, in
% order to facilitate merging and manipulation commands. This
% merging-operator is executed with squared brackets, and is able
% to horizontally or vertically concatenate matrices, which is 
% the process of joining small matrices to make bigger ones.
% Strictly speaking, an assignment of multiple values at once is 
% nothing else than horizontally and vertically glueing together 
% scalar values.

% glueing together values 3 and 4 horizontally, assigning to c
c = [3 4]

% two ways to add additional row
d = [3 4; 2 3];
d = [c; 2 3];

% glueing together block matrices
[[d; c] x]

%%
% In order to simplify code, some often used matrices can be 
% accessed by calling existing functions.

% determine matrix size
m = 2;
n = 3;

% create matrix containing ones
onesMatr = ones(m,n)

% create matrix containing zeros
zeroMatr = zeros(m,n)

% create matrix containing uniformly distributed random numbers 
unifMatr = rand(m,n)

%%
% In addition, MATLAB has an operator to create numerical
% sequences with constant increments. This operator is called
% with three numbers and two colons. 

% increments of size 2, starting at 1, ending at 11
1:2:11

% increments of size 5.5, starting at 14, ending at 40
14:5.5:40

%%
% In case of increments of size 1, one can also use the short
% notation involving only one colon together with a number
% specifying the starting value and a number specifying the
% ending value.

% increments of size 1, starting at 1, ending at 4
1:4

%%
% Both concatenation and the colon operator to create number
% sequences can be used to simultaneously retrieve information 
% about matrix entries. The basic notation here is that a vector
% at the first entry in square brackets refers to all rows
% involved, while a vector at the second entry refers to all
% columns involved. In doing so, the set of all indices involved 
% is given by the intersection of the specified rows and columns.

% display entries (1,3), (1,2) and (1,3) of x
[x(1,3) x(1,2) x(1,3)]

% same result, as intersection of row 1 with columns
x(1,[3 2 3])

% 2x2 upper block matrix
x([1 2],[1 2])

% using number sequence
x(1:2,1:2)

%%
% In cases of unknown matrix size, the last element also can be
% accessed with replacement statement "end".

% display last two rows and last two columns
x(2:end,2:end)
x(end-1:end,end-1:end)

%%
% Using the colon operator without additional numbers denotes
% either a complete row or a complete column of a matrix. 

% concatenate once the first and twice the third column of a
c = [x(:,1) x(:,3) x(:,3)];

% additionally append last row of x
c = [c; x(end,:)]

%%
% The same syntax also can be utilized to delete complete columns
% or rows from a matrix. Just specify the desired horizontal or
% vertical line via the colon operator, and assign an empty
% matrix to it.

% delete third column
c(:,3) = []

%% Matrix calculation
% MATLAB is able to perform the standard operations on matrices.

% addition
x = [2 3; 4 2];
b = [1; 2];
bMatr = b(1:2,[1 1])
c = x + bMatr

% subtraction
c = x - bMatr;

%%
% While addition and subtraction operate elementwise,
% matrix multiplication does not. Matrix multiplication is
% defined as scalar products of row and column vectors.

% multiplication of 2x2 matrix c with 2x1 vector b
matrProd1 = c*b
matrProd2 = [c(1,1)*b(1)+c(1,2)*b(2); c(2,1)*b(1)+c(2,2)*b(2)]

%%
% Matrix division is defined as inversion to matrix
% multiplication on square matrices.
matrProd = x*c

% retrieve x by reversion
matrProd/c
x

% this equals multiplication with inverse of c
matrProd*inv(c)

%% 
% However, when working with MATLAB in statistical applications, we
% usually interpret matrices as tables of data. Hence, performing
% matrix operations on matrices might not be the most natural way to
% process numeric variables. For example, let nSold denote a vector
% containing the number of sold products on consecutive days, while
% prices denotes a vector which contains the average achieved price
% per sale. We want to get a vector profits of same length as nSold
% and prices, containing the profits for each day.

% initialize sale vector
nSold = [2 3 2 1]

% initialize price vector
prices = [2.3 2.4 2.3 2.0]

% notation for elementwise multiplication
profits = nSold.*prices

%% 
% While addition and subtraction are the same for arrays and
% matrices, element-by-element operations on arrays have to be
% called with a dot in front of the operator.
% This rule also applies to some additional operators. Hence,
% element-wise division is called by ./, while exponentiating can
% be conducted with the .^ operator. Together with the numeric
% sequence operator, element-wise operations are very useful to
% evaluating functions on certain values and creating tables.
% For example, say you would have to evaluate the function 
% f(x)=3*x^2+7*x at values 1 to 10.

% init(ialize) grid for points that shall be evaluated
grid = 1:10;

% for each entry of grid, evaluate function per element-wise
% operations
grid 
squared = grid.^2
squaredScaled = 3*squared
scaled = 7*grid
vals = squaredScaled+scaled


%% Graphical output
% Whenever we need to visualize the graph of a function based on 
% existing tabulated values, we have to draw a line through the
% calculated values, thereby interpolating the function in
% between. The interpolated values are determined by MATLAB
% itself, so that we only have to pass the tabulated values to 
% MATLAB. One-dimensional functions usually are best visualized
% with the command plot, which draws a line through specified
% points. Since each point of the function is given by two
% coordinates (x- and y-value), the plot command also needs both
% dimensions as input.

% passing coordinates for each points to visualization function
plot(grid,vals)     % vector of x-values, vector of y-values

%%
% When using any graphical visualization command an additional
% window opens, which has to be understood as consisting of two 
% parts. The first part is the figure window itself. This part,
% for example, contains information about the size of the window 
% as well as about the reference number of the figure. The second
% part is an axes object, and can be seen as the white colored
% rectangle within the gray window. This axes object contains
% information about the used axes, where they begin and where 
% they end, and where additional ticks are shown in between.
% Furthermore, labels of the ticks, fontsizes of the labels as
% well as coordinates for the exact positioning of the white
% rectangle inside of the gray rectangle are properties of the
% axes object. These properties can not be accessed directly, 
% but have to be changed via methods performing on the object 
% (get() and set()).

%% Functions
% Besides the existing operators that can be used to data
% manipulation and calculation, MATLAB also includes functions
% that can be called. Usually, a call to a function requires some
% additional input handed over to the function and is associated
% with some output calculated by the function. For example,
% function exp() calculates the exponential function at a given
% value.

% calculate exponential function at point 3
exp(3)

% calculate log function at point 1
log(1)

%% 
% As already outlined above, financial applications usually 
% perform analysis on data, so that matrices rather have to be 
% seen as arrays or tables of data, instead of as matrices 
% expressing algebraic content. This way, element-wise operations
% become more accentuated, which is the reason that most built-in
% MATLAB functions accept matrices as input, where each entry
% will be processed by the function on its own. This way we can
% calculate more than one point of the exponential function at a
% time.

% init points where exp shall be evaluated
grid = -4:0.02:4;

% calculate associated function values
vals = exp(grid);

%%
% Using function size, we can see that the dimensions of the
% output vals complies with the dimensions of the input vector.
% This is not surprising, since exactly one function value has to
% be calculated for each point given in the input vector.

% get size of input
inputSize = size(grid) % first number: number of rows

% get size of output
outputSize = size(vals)

%% 
% Now the exponential function can be visualized in the known
% way.

% visualize function values
plot(grid,vals)

%%
% As a first example for manipulation of the axes object, suppose we
% wanted to shrink the section of the x-values depicted, which equals
% zooming into the picture. In order to apply a method to an axes
% object, we first have to specify the exact object. In this case, it
% is possible to refer to the axes object as current axes, since it is
% the last axes object that we created. This is done by gca (get
% current axes).

% use method set() on current axes, change property x-limits
set(gca,'xLim',[-2 2])

%%
% Before we will conduct a first meaningful application, we now
% shortly want to deal with a main problem in computer based
% applications. Suppose you want to perform a certain
% manipulation on your data. How do you know, whether there
% already exists a MATLAB function performing this task, and if
% there was any, how would you find it?
% One way is to use the lookfor command. With it, you can search
% the MATLAB documentary for certain keywords. MATLAB then will
% search the first line of the help text of all functions on the
% search path for a certain keyword.

% find a function that performs permutation on vector elements
lookfor permutation

%% 
% Another way would be to let MATLAB display all functions in a
% given category. For example, request all elementary matrices
% and matrix manipulation:

help elmat

%%
% Other category names would be "specfun" for special functions
% and "elfun" for elementary functions.
% Of course, an additional and usually worthwhile option would be
% to simply type some keywords into Google's search engine.

%% Try yourself
% You should now try yourself at the "Matlab basics - practice" part in
% Matlab Coursework.

%% For-loops and linearization
% Now we want to plot the density function of a normal 
% distribution. The formular for the density function is given by
% f(x)=(2*pi*sigma)^(-0.5)*exp(-0.5*((x-mu)^2/sigma)). In the
% course of this application we also introduce the syntax for
% loops in MATLAB, and show their performance with a different
% approach using simple matrix calculations.
% A loop executes a series of commands for a pre-specified number
% of iterations. However, any loop usually needs a running
% variable that changes at each iteration. For example, if you
% want to store the results of your code inside the loop, you
% would have to adapt the index of your storing variable, in
% order to not overwrite your results.
% The syntax of loops is rather simple. Just type "for" to
% indicate the beginning of a loop, choose a running variable and
% specify a vector of values which will be taken by the running
% variable.


% init params
mu = 2;
sigma = 1.4;
grid = -2:0.01:6;

tic     % start MATLAB's stopwatch to return processing time of
        % for loop
for ii=1:numel(grid)   % Chronologically, for each point in grid.
                       % numel() returns number of elements
    x = grid(ii);      % current x-value for density evaluation
    y(ii) = (2*pi*sigma)^(-0.5)*exp(-0.5*((x-mu)^2/sigma));
        % adapt index of storing variable to avoid overwriting
end     % end of loop
time1 = toc;    % get time required to execute code from tic to 
                % toc and store it in variable time1
                
                
%% 
% While the code is very intuitive and simple, there are two main
% drawbacks with respect to performance.
% First, since you have not told MATLAB prior to the execution of
% the loop, how large your storing variable y will get, MATLAB
% will take any free space in its memory to store the variable y
% at the first run of the loop. However, since the required
% storage of y will increase during each loop, it could happen
% that y at some point will need more storage than what is 
% available at the previously chosen location in its memory. In
% consequence, MATLAB would have to take all stored results in y
% and shift them to another and bigger place in its memory, which
% is rather time-consuming. Therefore, you always should tell
% MATLAB beforehand how large your storage variable will get.
% And secondly, since MATLAB is optimized for matrix
% calculations, you always have to try to linearize your code in
% order to avoid for loops. Here is an improved version of the
% code, using element-wise function evaluations on grid:

tic
y = (2*pi*sigma)^(-0.5) * exp(-0.5*(grid-mu).^2/sigma);
time2 = toc;

% visualization to check for mistakes
plot(grid,y)

% calculate factor of performance improvement
factor = time1/time2;

% formatted output
fprintf('\nSecond code is faster with factor %3.3f\n',factor);
    % \n stands for change to new line 
    % %3.3f is the format for the ouput of the variable inserted

%% 
% Of course, such an important function is already implemented in
% MATLAB. Hence, the same results also can be obtained by

% y = normpdf(grid,mu,sigma);

%% 
% In order to further highlight the importance of preallocation,
% we will try a second example.

tic
N = 10e3;
x(1) = 1000;
for k=2:N
    x(k) = 1.05*x(k-1);
end
time1 = toc;

tic
N = 10e3;
x = zeros(N,1);
x(1) = 1000;
for k=2:N
    x(k) = 1.05*x(k-1);
end
time2 = toc;

fprintf('\nPart one takes %2.3d times longer.\n',time1/time2)

%%
% The same performance improvements also apply to the case of a
% two-dimensional normal distribution. However, we first
% introduce two further helpful operators in MATLAB. The first is
% the transpose operator, which forms the complex conjugate
% transpose of a matrix, i.e. it simply transposes matrices
% without complex part.

% init random matrix
x = rand(3)

% show transposition
transp = x'

%%
% The second operator is the vectorization operator. Applied to a
% matrix, it takes each column and attaches it at the bottom of
% the previous columns to get one large vector containing all
% entries of matrix a.

% vectorization, with subsequent transposition to keep displayed 
% output space-saving
x(:)'

% These operations will prove useful in the performance-improved
% encoding of the two-dimensional density. But first we will
% implement the more easy way using for loops.

            % Note: when plotting a matrix, row vectors will
            % appear in x-direction. Hence, the first for-loop

% In effect this code does the following: it choses the value of 
% the x-coordinate, holds it fixed, and runs through all 
% y-coordinate values.
% Since in graphical outputs of matrices the x-axis is defined as
% the row dimension, the code evaluates column after column of
% the final density value matrix.

%%
% We now have to achieve a similar result without using 
% for-loops. Lets first concentrate on the values of the
% x-coordinate matrix. In order to replicate this matrix, we just
% have to stick three times the original grid vector above each
% other. A very useful function for such a task is repmat, which
% stands for "replicate matrix", and allows you to form a block
% matrix consisting of smaller matrices which are replicates of a
% given matrix.

% example
x = [1 2; 3 4];

% 2 replicates of x above each other, 3 next to each other
repmat(x,2,3)

%% String variables
% String variables represent series of characters. In order to
% assign a string to a variable, the expression has to be
% enclosed with apostrophes. This way, MATLAB automatically
% defines the variable's type as string.

s = 'This is a string!'

%%
% Strings also can be packed into a matrix. However, a string in
% a matrix has to be interpreted as an array of individual
% characters. Hence, in order to pack two strings into a matrix,
% the string dimensions have to match the same way as the
% dimensions of row vectors have to match in a matrix with
% numeric entries.

s = ['abc';'cba']

%%
% Using strings of different lengths produces an error.

try
    t = ['abc'; 'abcd']
catch err
    err.message
end

%% Cell variables
% Cell arrays are used when variables of different types shall be
% stored in a single variable. For example, an entry in a cell 
% array can contain a numeric value as well as a matrix with 
% numeric entries. Furthermore, it can also obtain a string (an
% array of characters) or a structure variable. In contrast to
% the variable types so far, cell arrays are initialized using
% curled brackets!

c = {'abe','kdkdkd'}

c{2,1} = 4535

x = [2 3 2; 1 2 2; 4 5 6];
c{2,2} = x

%%
% Imagine, you wanted to store historic stock prices in a cell
% array. Hence, you could fill one entry with a string variable
% containing the name of the stock, one entry with a matrix of
% numeric values containing the closing prices and one entry with
% a matrix containing associated dates. One problem when working
% with cell arrays is, that you always have to keep track
% about the arrangement of the different variables in the cell
% array yourself! This way, your code becomes more error prone,
% since you could accidentially mix up the entries, and overwrite
% the stock prices, while you only wanted to change the name of
% the stock. 
% In order to improve the code with respect to this danger of
% confusions, MATLAB has come up with a way to store different
% data types, where the individual entries are not indexed with
% numbers, but with field names. Such variables are called
% structure variables.

%% Structure variables
% When using structure variables, individual fields are addressed
% by simple name extensions to the name of the variable.
% Consider a structure variabe stock1 containing stock 
% information.

stock1.name = 'BMW';

stock1.dates = ['01.02.2001';'02.02.2001';'03.02.2001'];

stock1.prices = [112; 114; 111];

stock1

%%
% In order to display the information of a structure variable,
% one has to use a similar syntax.

stock1.dates

%%
% The same syntax also has to be used when information of a field
% shall be assigned to a new variable. 

dates = stock1.dates

%% Tables
% Since version R2013b Matlab also has a data structure similar to
% DataFrames in R. These tables allow to store data of mixed types, the
% only restriction being that all columns need to be of equal length.
% For the advantages of tables take a look at the online documentation at
% http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/matlab/matlab_prog/advantages-of-using-tables.html 

load patients

patientTable = table(Gender,Age,Smoker,Diastolic);

% get subset of data as table
subTable = patientTable(:, 1:2);

% get subset of data as matrix
valuesThemself = patientTable{:, 2:4};

% get invalid subset of data
try
    invalidData = patientTable{:, 1:2}
catch err
    err.message
end

%% Tables: logical indexing
% still to come

%% mathematical functions
% could corrupt logical data: all patients become smokers
patientTable{:, 2:4} = patientTable{:, 2:4} + 3000
