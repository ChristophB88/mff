% This is the second part of the MATLAB course. Here we will
% show how to download real data and how this data can be further
% processed.
%
% Then, as first application, we will examine whether some
% theoretical relationships between risk and return can be found
% in german stock data. This analysis will be based on regression
% models.
%
% Subsequently, we will try to find deterministic trends in stock
% market data based on curve fitting approaches.
% Only the next script will show common approaches to
% modelling of stock market returns as stochastic variables.

%% Load historic DAX prices
% The following code provides an example of the usage of the
% function hist_stock_data, which is able to download historic
% stock prices and trading volumes based on the data provided by
% Yahoo!finance. In order to make the data comply with our
% requirements, some additional treatments are needed first.

% specify ticker symbol as string variable
tickSym = '^GDAXI';     % specify stock data of interest

% specify beginning and ending as string variables
dateBeg = '01011990';   %  day, month, year: ddmmyyyy
dateEnd = '01072013';

%% 
% Alternatively, dates also can be determined dynamically,
% with regard to today. Since the MATLAB command "today" measures
% time on a numeric scale, the value displayed is a number.

% display date of today
fprintf(['\nToday is ' num2str(today) '.\n'])
    % Note: fprintf is able to display a string to the command
    % window, without having to assign it to a variable or MATLAB's
    % temporary placeholder "ans" (short for "answer") first. In
    % order to get the input string, in this case we first have to
    % concatenate smaller strings into one large string.

%%
% In order to make the numeric data value more meaningful, we can
% transform it with the function datestr() into a date
% expression. As a string, this can be directly assigned to the
% variable declaring the end of the data period requested.

% dynamic assignment to end of period
dateEnd = datestr(today, 'ddmmyyyy')  % today as last date

%% 
% However, instead of using "today", you also can use the command
% "date", which returns the date as string right away.

fprintf(['\nToday is ' date '.\n'])

%%
% In order to download data from Yahoo!finance, we make use of
% the function hist_stock_data. This function can be found at the
% MATLAB File Exchange at 
% http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/. 
% The File Exchange is a place where users can find and share
% content related to MATLAB development.

% load data
daxCrude = hist_stock_data(dateBeg, dateEnd, tickSym);

%%
% The function hist_stock_data returns a structure variable. A
% more detailed insight into the formatting of the output can be
% achieved with queries.

daxCrude
exampleDateEntries = daxCrude.Date(1:4)

%%
% As the second query shows, historic prices are ordered with latest
% observations first. This configuration is disadvantageous for
% further work, since plotting of the prices would show the latest
% observations to the left. Moreover, instead of storing the dates as
% a cell array of string variables, we will achieve more flexibility
% if we store dates as serial dates, which is the same conversion we
% already encountered with the today command. In this numeric scale,
% each date is assigned to a uniquely specified number. As anchor
% point of this system, January 1st, 0000, is assigned to the value
% one.

fprintf(['Number 1 is equal to the date ' datestr(1) '.\n'])

%%
% In order to switch between dates given as strings and numeric
% serial dates the functions datestr and datenum can be used. Now we
% want to convert the date strings to serial dates.

serialDates = datenum(daxCrude.Date, 'yyyy-mm-dd');
% second argument specifies input format of string dates

%%
% In accordance with common convention prices and dates shall be
% arranged in increasing order, with most recent data at the end.
% Instead of manually encoding a for-loop, the MATLAB function
% flipud can be used to flip both matrices upside down. The
% results will be assigned to fields of a new structure variable 
% called dax.

% flip most recent entries to the end
dax.dates = flipud(serialDates);    % initializes structure dax
dax.prices = flipud(daxCrude.Close);

%% Plotting financial data
% When plotting financial data, we usually want the x-axis to be
% denoted in dates instead of numeric values. This can be done
% with help of the command "datetick", which interprets values of 
% the respective axis as serial dates, and converts the labels of
% the individual ticks into meaningful date strings. 

%%
% Further adjustments to graphical representations can be
% achieved by manual configuration of figure sizes, as well as
% additional graphics in one figure window. Both concepts are
% applied in the following illustration.

figure('position',[50 50 1200 600]) % create gray window, left 
                                    % corner at latitude 50,
                                    % height 50, with width 1200
                                    % and height 600

subplot(1, 2, 1);     % Include two different white windows within 
                    % the gray figure window. 1,2 denotes
                    % arrangement (one row, two columns of white
                    % windows), while the last number (1) denotes 
                    % the currently used window.
               
% use plot command without further adjustments                    
plot(dax.prices) % since no x-values are specified, MATLAB 
                % automatically numbers observations from 1 to 
                % numel(dax.dates).
                
subplot(1, 2, 2);
plot(dax.dates, dax.prices)
datetick 'x'    % exact format of date labels can be chosen with 
                % additional input, e.g. try datetick('x', 29) and
                % datetick('x', 10)
xlabel('dates')
ylabel('prices')
title('historic DAX values')

% crop x-axis to relevant size only
set(gca, 'xLim',[dax.dates(1) dax.dates(end)])

%%
% As can be seen at the command line used to crop the x-axis, 
% though MATLAB renders the x-axis labels to date strings, it 
% still needs references denoted in numeric values. That is, it 
% is not possible to directly tell MATLAB to restrict the axis to
% 01.01.2000 to 31.12.2002 for example. Indexing with date
% strings is generally not possible. Hence, simple graphical
% modifications may become quite cumbersome. 
% As first example, the maximum value during the period shall be
% highlighted with a red point. The general way to do this will
% be to first find the entry with the highest point in the price
% vector, which will be given as index value relative to the
% price matrix. Then, the index has to be converted into the
% respective index of the serial dates vector. In most cases,
% lengths of price and serial dates vectors will coincide, so
% that nothing needs to be done in this step. At last, this index
% is used to get the value of the serial dates vector at the
% respective entry.

%% Logical indexing
% In order to find certain specified values in a given matrix,
% MATLAB usually makes use of the concept of logical indexing. In
% logical notation, a value of zero represents "no", while a
% value of "1" has to be interpreted as "yes". Hence, for example,
% when checking whether the entries of a matrix fulfill a given
% condition, MATLAB checks the condition on each entry, and
% returns a logical matrix of same size filled with zeros and 
% ones.

% init matrix
matr = [1 2 3 4 5 6]

% check if entries are greater than 3
greaterThan3 = matr>3

% matrix greaterThan3 is logical variable
logicalCheck = islogical(greaterThan3)

%% 
% Such logical matrices created from logical or relational 
% operations can be used to extract values of a given matrix.
% However, these extracted values are always returned arranged in
% vectors, so that information about the position in the original
% matrix is lost.

% get values greater than 3
valuesGreater3 = matr(greaterThan3)

%%
% In order to compare numerical values, MATLAB uses relational
% operators.

% equal to
equalThree = (matr == 3)   % since single equal signs are already 
                        % used for assignments, MATLAB notation
                        % requires two equality signs to check
                        % for equality

% less or equal
lessEqualThree = (matr <= 3)   % greater or equal: >=

% not equal to
notEqualThree = (matr ~= 3)

%%
% Matrix manipulation also can be done based on logical indexing.
% For example, set each value of matr below three to zero.

% new matrix given by
matr(matr<3)=0

% multiply each entry greater than 4 with 10
matr(matr>4) = 4*matr(matr>4)

%% 
% In order to check more than one condition, MATLAB also includes
% operators to combine logical matrices.

% create two random logicals
log1 = (rand(3)>0.5)
log2 = (rand(3)>0.5)

% elementwise AND: both logicals have to be 1
AND = (log1 & log2)

% elementwise OR: at least one of both logicals has to be 1
OR = (log1 | log2)

% NONE: elementwise AND inverted with tilde command
NONE = ~AND

%% 
% In order to not lose information about the position of entries
% within a matrix, you can use the find() function, which returns
% the indices of the first k entries which fulfill a certain
% condition. However, note that indices are given in single
% index notation.

matr
greater20 = (matr>=20) % shows logical matrix: indices could be read 
                    % off manually
find(matr>=20)     % automatically returns all indices with logical 
                % value one
find(matr>=20, 1)   % returns only first index with logical value one

%% Exercises: logical indexing
% In order to deepen your understanding of logical indexing, you now
% should try yourself at the logical indexing assignment at the
% coursework homepage on https://coursework.mathworks.com.

%%
% Returning to the original intention to highlight the maximum
% price value, this gives

% find index of maximum price
ind = find(dax.prices == max(dax.prices), 1);

% find associated serial date
maxDate = dax.dates(ind);

% include in subplot(1, 2, 2)
subplot(1, 2, 2)
hold on;    % allows to add elements, without deleting previous 
            % graphic

plot(maxDate, max(dax.prices), '.r', 'MarkerSize', 18)
shg         % show current graphic: pops up figure window again
hold off;   % next graphic will not be included again

%%
% Despite of going this quite cumbersome programmatic way, MATLAB
% also allows interactive request in figures. This way, press the
% "Data Cursor" button in the figures toolbar, select the global
% maximum on your own by clicking on it, then right click on
% datatip, and "Export Cursor Data to Workspace". Set name
% to maxPrice. This exports information about the maximum stock 
% price into a structure called maxPrice.


%%
% Instead of absolute prices, investors usually are more
% interested in returns of the dax, where absolute gains / losses
% are put in relation to the capital invested. Since each return
% needs one starting value and one ending value, the length of
% the time series will decrease by one. Hence, also the date
% vector has to be adapted.

% transform prices to discrete percentage returns
dax.disRet = 100*(dax.prices(2:end) - dax.prices(1:end-1))./...
    dax.prices(1:end-1);

% As can be seen, the return series exhibits phases of different
% volatilities. While most of the time rather small returns
% occur, there are also times were both positive and negative
% returns are persistently larger. This observation is usually
% refered to as volatility clusters, and is understood as a
% stylized fact about stock market data. However, when focussing
% on longer investment horizons, we usually neglect the
% information about the exact times of occurrence of each return,
% and take a look at the distribution of returns only. This is
% done with a histogram.

%% Regression analysis
% One of the most important models also in econometrics is the
% linear model. Hence, the following lines show the
% implementation and estimation of a linear regression model in
% MATLAB. First, we sample from a specified linear model.

% init params
nSim = 1000;       % sample size
muX = 12;       % params explanatory variable
sigmaX = 2.3;
coeff = 0.8;    % regression coefficient
intcept = 4.3;  % regression intercept

% simulate explanatory variable
xMatr = normrnd(muX, sigmaX, nSim, 1);

% simulate standard normally distributed innovations
epsilon = randn(nSim, 1);

% calculate Y according to linear model
yMatr = intcept + coeff*xMatr + epsilon;    % do not use for loop

%%
% Now we want to estimate the parameters of the model based on
% the values simulated. 

% because of intercept, expand matrix of explanatory variables
xMatr = [ones(nSim, 1) xMatr];

% OLS estimation, naive way
paramsHat = inv(xMatr'*xMatr)*xMatr'*yMatr;    
% usual estimation formula 

% avoiding single matrix inversion as mlint warning suggests
paramsHat2 = (xMatr'*xMatr)\(xMatr'*yMatr);      % faster way
paramsHat3 = xMatr\yMatr;                % best way

% calculate regression line
xLimits = [floor(min(xMatr(:, 2))) ceil(max(xMatr(:, 2)))];   
                                 % use nearest
                                 % neighbouring integer numbers
grid = xLimits(1):0.1:xLimits(2);       
vals = paramsHat(1)+paramsHat(2)*grid;

%%
% Because of the risk-aversion of investors, theoretical models
% often conclude that riskier assets should in general coincide
% with higher expected returns, since investors demand higher
% compensation for the risk involved. As a first application of
% the linear model, we want to investigate whether this positive
% relationship can be verified for German stock data. Therefore,
% we will download historical data of all 30 components of the
% German stock market index DAX, estimate their mean return and 
% return standard deviation, and regress the mean returns on the
% standard deviations. Note that standard deviation is only one
% way to measure inherent risk, and one common criticism is that
% the symmetrical nature of standard deviation measures positive
% deviations the same way as negative ones.

% Exercise:
%

%%
% In order to eliminate data points with missing values and to

% one missing observation is only one possible way to process data. For a
% more elaborate overview over different ways to deal with missing

% the market, called systematic risk. Since this risk component
% underlies each asset, it can not be diversified away. Hence,
% investors need to be compensated for it.
% In contrast to that, the remaining risk inherent in an asset is
% called the idiosyncratic risk. This component is stock
% specific, and hence not correlated with idiosyncratic
% components of other firms. Hence, in a large portfolio of
% assets, this component could be diversified away.

%%
% In order to measure each assets' comovement with the market, we
% perform a linear regression of the daily returns on daily
% returns of a market index. Note that the theory is based on
% dependence to a market portfolio, where our market index here 
% is only an imperfect substitution.

%%
% Note that this analysis is only a very rough investigation of
% the validity of the CAPM, with many sources of error involved
% (only substitute for market portfolio, applied to returns
% instead of excess returns,...). In fact, the purpose merely was
% to come up with some easy example of regression analysis in
% finance. So do not make the mistake to interpret the
% investigations as scientifically rigurous and adequate
% approach. As part of a more thorough investigation at least 
% also returns of larger time horizons would have to be examined.

%% Stock price prediction based on curve fitting
% While the previous part was concerned with looking for an
% explanatory variable for stock returns, we now will try to find
% regularities in stock prices that allow to make predictions on
% future price movements. That is, in course of its evolution,
% any stock price seems to follow some trend at some point of
% time. Looking at charts of stock prices one usually might be
% tempted to assume that such trends could be identified in
% real-time, thereby allowing for speculative trading 
% opportunities. The idea in this chapter is to fit certain
% functions to historic stock price paths. Given that the
% function seems to be a good approximation to past prices,
% chance might be that it will still be an approximation in the
% future, so that our function could be used as stock price 
% predictor.
% However, the approach taken here is slightly different. Based
% on curve fitting tools, positive trends in stock prices shall
% be identified. But instead of trying to exactly predict future
% prices, we only try to identify points in time where the
% current dynamic changes. That is, we only try to predict
% break-offs of rising stock prices, without bothering with the
% exact type of regime evolving after the break-off.

%%
% Given that returns fluctuate around a constant positive value,
% prices should exhibit exponential growth. Such growth rates
% best can be seen on logarithmic scale, since they correspond to
% a straight line here. Hence, we first extend the data structure
% with an additional field logPrices. Visualization shows that
% DAX prices tend to exhibit super-exponential growth during
% certain periods.

% get log prices
dax.logPrices = log(dax.prices);

% specify subperiod as strings
begT = '01-Jun-1993';
endT = '29-Jul-1998';

% find indices associated with considered period
indS = find(dax.dates > datenum(begT, 'dd-mmm-yyyy'), 1);
indE = find(dax.dates > datenum(endT, 'dd-mmm-yyyy'), 1);

%%
% Note: it is not possible to access the prices with indexing
% based on the dates of the time series. Hence, dates always have
% to be converted to chronological indices first. However, the
% finance toolbox of MATLAB also includes financial time series
% objects (fints) that can be indexed by date strings. For
% example, myfts({'05/11/99', '05/21/99', '05/31/99'}) extracts
% the values of the fints object myfts at the specified dates.

% With the straight line as benchmark, one can see that the stock

% This pattern indicates super-exponential growth rates. Such 
% growth rates usually are associated with stock market bubbles.
% Our intention now will be to identify evolving stock market
% bubbles, and try to predict the time they burst.
% According to Didier Sornette and his colleagues, stock market
% bubbles can be approximated with super-exponentially growing 
% log-periodic power law (LPPL) functions. These are 
% super-exponentially growing functions with finite-time 
% singularities and oscillating behaviour, given by the formula:
% f(x) = a_1 + a_2*(a_3-x)^(a_4)*
%       (1+a_5*cos(a_6*log(a_3-a_8*x)+a_7).
% In order to get an impression about the appropriateness of a
% LPPL function, we will fit it the subperiod and compare its
% mean squared error to the error of a simple exponential
% fucntion. Furthermore, we will examine whether the date of the
% estimated finite-time singularity could be used as indicator of
% a forthcoming change in regimes.
